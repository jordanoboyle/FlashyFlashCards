# Flash Card Study Tool
Currently a simple application that allows for the creation of flashcards or a question/answer type game. The application has simple functionality. You can create flashcards and store them in local storage or clear themselves out as well. 

## Project Overview
   This application does not use a third party API currently, thought that may change in the future. Fire up the application with the instructions below and make as many flash cards as you like. I intend to add mobile media queries to make sure it works on small devices as well. 

## Features
   - You can create flash cards
   - Cards are stored in local storage. 
   - Little CSS animations for card transitions for interactive feel.
   - Clear out all the cards as needed.

## Future
   - I intend to add a delete function for the individual cards. 
   - Would also like to add customization of card colors.
   - Add possible custom fonts
   - Three stage cards that show how you get to a challenges solution. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, I recommend using the **Live Server** extension in VSCode. Itâ€™s a straightforward and enjoyable way to serve your project.

- **Live Server Extension**: [ritwickdey.LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Instructions

1. **Install Live Server**: If you haven't installed the Live Server extension, you can do so from the VSCode marketplace.
2. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your VSCode.
3. **Start the Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.
   - Alternatively, click on the **Go Live** button in the bottom right corner of VSCode.
4. **Access the Application**: Your browser should automatically open with a local server running on port `5500`.

If you prefer using another local server like MAMP, feel free to do so.


## Customization
This is open-source and the code is free to be cloned and used as needed. Some of the CSS is a bit wonky because I am testing different ideas.
